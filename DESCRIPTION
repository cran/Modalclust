Description: Performs Modal Clustering (MAC) including Hierarchical Modal Clustering (HMAC) along with their parallel implementation (PHMAC) over several processors.  These model-based non-parametric clustering techniques can extract  clusters in very high dimensions with arbitrary density shapes. By default clustering is performed over several resolutions and the results are summarised as a hierarchical tree. Associated plot functions are also provided. There is a package vignette that provides many examples. This version adheres to CRAN policy of not spanning more than two child processes by default.
